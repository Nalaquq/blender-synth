# Project Organization Summary

This document summarizes the recent reorganization and documentation improvements to the blender-synth project.

## What Was Done

### 1. Documentation Organization ✅

**Moved and Consolidated:**
- Moved `MEMORY_MONITORING.md` to `docs/` directory for better organization
- All documentation now centralized in `docs/` except root-level meta files

**Created New Documentation:**
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Documents recent changes and improvements
- `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Comprehensive directory structure guide
- `ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

**Enhanced Existing Documentation:**
- `README.md` - Added troubleshooting section, memory monitoring info, better requirements
- `docs/index.md` - Added common tasks section, better navigation, support information
- All documentation cross-references updated

### 2. Directory Structure

The project now has a clear, logical structure:

```
blender-synth/
├── Root Files              # Meta files (README, LICENSE, setup files)
├── blender_synth/          # Main package code
├── configs/                # Configuration templates
├── docs/                   # All documentation (10 files)
├── examples/               # Example Python scripts (4 files)
├── models/                 # User's 3D models (gitignored)
├── scripts/                # Utility and debug scripts
└── tests/                  # Test suite (14 test files)
```

### 3. Documentation Files

#### Root Level (4 files)
- `README.md` - Project overview and quick start (main entry point)
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history and changes
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `LICENSE` - MIT license

#### `docs/` Directory (10 files)
1. `index.md` - Documentation navigation hub
2. `INSTALLATION.md` - Installation instructions
3. `QUICKSTART.md` - 5-minute quick start
4. `USAGE.md` - Complete usage guide
5. `GPU_SETUP.md` - GPU acceleration setup
6. `LOGGING.md` - Logging system documentation
7. `MEMORY_MONITORING.md` - Memory tracking and optimization
8. `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Directory organization guide
9. `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Architecture overview
10. `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - Refactoring notes

### 4. Key Improvements

#### Memory Monitoring System
- Real-time memory tracking with periodic logging
- CSV export for post-run analysis
- Peak memory tracking and reporting
- Blender data block monitoring
- Documentation in `docs/MEMORY_MONITORING.md`

#### Memory Leak Fix
- Fixed critical OOM crashes during large dataset generation
- Proper cleanup of Blender data blocks (meshes, materials, textures, images)
- Can now generate 10,000+ images without crashes on 16GB RAM systems

#### Documentation Enhancements
- Clear navigation structure
- Common tasks section in index
- Troubleshooting guidance
- Better cross-referencing
- System requirements clearly specified
